# Description
This project was made by me (Ben) and a friend (Ryan) more as a proof of concept. We wanted to be able to incorporate many different forms of game, using as much functionality of a mobile device as possible.

This was made in Unity, using C#, and was originally developed on a local network. This project never continued as it was more for both of us to learn Unity more thoroughly, while being able to be creative and develop games as we wanted to.
